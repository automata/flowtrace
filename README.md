# Flowtrace

A `flowtrace` is a persisted record of the execution of an Flow-based Programming
network. It is used for retroactive debugging

The concept is analogous to a 'stacktrace' or 'core dump' for imperative code.

This project will define a data format to store traces in,
and debugging tools for working with these traces.
