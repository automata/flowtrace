# Flowtrace

A `flowtrace` is a persisted record of the execution of an Flow-based Programming (FBP) or dataflow program.
It is used for retroactive (after-the-fact) debugging; to locate, understand and fix bugs. 

The concept is analogous to a 'stacktrace' or 'core dump' for imperative code.

This project will define a data format to store traces in,
and provide debugging tools for working with these traces.
